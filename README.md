This is a CS50 Project 3, a Django web application.

Basically, you can select stuffs from the menu UI to add to a cart. 
You can select toppings or add extra stuffs to your sub sandwich. 
On the cart page, you can view total cost of items in it can either finalize the order or clear the cart. 

If you are a superuser, you can use adminer UI tool to view transaction, change the delivery status of each invidual transaction, add items to menu.

My apology to everyone who reads this code. 
I felt stupid after coding this because I realized I could have shorten the code by half with proper models planning.
